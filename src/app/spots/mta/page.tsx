            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Mount Arayat, an isolated potentially active stratovolcano,
              dominates the landscape of the Central Luzon plains in Pampanga,
              Philippines. Rising to a height of 1,033 meters (3,389 ft), it
              offers breathtaking views and a rich history intertwined with
              folklore and legends.  Its southern half lies within the
              municipality of Arayat, while its northern half and summit are in
              Magalang.  Ten miles to the west is Angeles City, and 75km south
              lies Manila.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
              The mountain features a breached crater on its northwest side,
              evidence of past volcanic activity.  The breach is about 1.2km in
              diameter. Weak steaming is still present in some eroded vents,
              suggesting the volcano is still potentially active. The only
              dated rocks are 530,000 and 650,000-year-old basalts, predating the
              collapse and formation of the lava dome known as White Rock.  An
              analysis report indicates an eruption within the last 2,000 years.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Mount Arayat was declared a national park in 1933 and a tourist
              spot in 1997. It is currently under threat from deforestation.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
          Mount Arayat is deeply embedded in Kapampangan mythology. It is
          believed to be the home of Aring Sinukuan (also known as Sinukuan or
          Sucu), a powerful male deity before Spanish colonization, later
          syncretized with the female diwata Maria Sinukuan.  He was a rival of
          Apu Namalyari of Mount Pinatubo.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
          Sinukuan was the god of the sun, war, and death, and taught the early
          inhabitants metallurgy, wood cutting, rice culture, and warfare. He had
          three children: Munag Sumala (dawn), Lakandanup (noon), and Gatpanapun
          (afternoon). He also had a winged giant eagle assistant, Galura.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
          The name "Arayat" has several possible origins, including from
          Fernando de Arayat, a Spanish encomiendero, from the Kapampangan word
          "dayatan&quot; (dry season rice crop), or from "Alaya" (east). Some even
          theorize a connection to the biblical Mount Ararat.
